+# Nerves System: Raspberry Pi 4 with HDMI-CEC Support
+
+This is a **custom Nerves system** for the Raspberry Pi 4 that enables reliable
+HDMI and CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) support out of the box.
+
+It’s based on the official [`nerves_system_rpi4`](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_rpi4)
+with kernel and Buildroot tweaks to make `/dev/cec0` and `cec-ctl` available at boot.
+
+---
+
+## 🔧 Features
+
+- **HDMI CEC enabled** (`vc4_hdmi_cec` built-in, not as module)
+- **KMS driver active** (`dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d`)
+- **HDMI hotplug forced** (so video stays up even without EDID)
+- **`v4l-utils`** included → provides the `cec-ctl` command
+- **`hdmi_ignore_cec_init=1`** prevents unwanted input switching on boot
+- Console output on HDMI (`tty1`)
+
+---
+
+## 🧰 Kernel Config Highlights
+
+```
+CONFIG_DRM_VC4=y
+CONFIG_DRM_VC4_HDMI_CEC=y
+CONFIG_MEDIA_CEC_SUPPORT=y
+CONFIG_CEC_CORE=y
+CONFIG_CEC_NOTIFIER=y
+```
+
+---
+
+## ⚙️ Boot Configuration (`boot/config.txt`)
+
+```
+# Force HDMI output
+hdmi_force_hotplug=1
+hdmi_drive=2
+
+# Enable KMS + CEC
+dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
+
+# Prevent auto input switch during firmware init
+hdmi_ignore_cec_init=1
+```
+
+---
+
+## 🧩 Buildroot Additions
+
+```
+BR2_PACKAGE_V4L_UTILS=y   # provides cec-ctl
+BR2_PACKAGE_TZDATA=y      # optional: time zone data
+```
+
+---
+
+## 🚀 Using in a Nerves App
+
+In your application’s `mix.exs`:
+
+```
+{:nerves_system_rpi4_cec,
+  github: "codestorm1/nerves_system_rpi4_cec",
+  tag: "v1.0.0",
+  runtime: false,
+  targets: :rpi4}
+```
+
+Then:
+
+```
+MIX_TARGET=rpi4 mix deps.get
+MIX_TARGET=rpi4 mix firmware
+mix upload nerves.local
+```
+
+After boot, test CEC:
+
+```
+ssh nerves.local
+cec-ctl -d0 --cec-version-1.4 --playback --osd-name Mutebox
+cec-ctl -d0 --show-topology
+```
+
+---
+
+## 🧹 Notes
+
+- Artifacts like `.tar.gz`, `.img`, and Buildroot outputs are ignored to keep the repo small.
+- To share pre-built images, attach them to GitHub **Releases** instead of committing them.
+- Buildroot caches (`buildroot/dl`, `output/`, etc.) are intentionally untracked.
+
+---
+
+## 🏷 Versioning
+
+- **v1.0.0** — initial release with CEC/HDMI/KMS support
+
+---
+
+Maintained by **codestorm1** ·  
+Based on the official Nerves Raspberry Pi 4 system.
